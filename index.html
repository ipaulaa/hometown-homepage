        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Code-land was founded in the early 21st century by a group of
          passionate programmers, artists, and engineers who dreamed of creating
          a place where technology and imagination could thrive together.
          Originally a small innovation hub, it quickly grew into a vibrant town
          known for celebrating the art and science of coding. The town’s name,
          Code-land, reflects its mission to honor the impact of programming on
          society while fostering a creative and inclusive environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heart of Code-land was built around its iconic attractions: the
          Syntax Sculpture Park, Binary Falls, and the Debugging Labyrinth, each
          symbolizing a unique aspect of the coding journey—from logic and
          precision to creativity and problem-solving. Over the years, Code-land
          became a destination for tech enthusiasts, educators, and innovators
          from around the world, hosting hackathons, tech expos, and art
          installations that push the boundaries of what’s possible with code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Code-land stands as a beacon of innovation, reminding us that
          coding isn’t just about algorithms—it’s about crafting solutions,
          telling stories, and building the future.
